# Telegram-Bot
A conversational bot which interacts with the basic commands and fetches the news as required.
It uses the WebHook method for interacting with the telegram.
For this method Flask is used at the backend and Ngrok is used for creating a public URL.
We used DialogFlow to generate a basic chat and some created intent for news. 
Using gnewsclient API we fetch news on the basis of the input provided.
A custom keyboard markup is created which offers various topics to choose from in the bot.
